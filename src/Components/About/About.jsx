              <h4>Software Developer based in Germiston, Gauteng. üìç</h4>
              <p>
                I'm Banele Thabede, and I'm eagerly seeking opportunities for
                internships or junior positions in software development.
                <br />
                While I may not have professional experience yet, I'm passionate
                about coding and have been honing my skills in various
                programming languages and technologies.
                <br />
                I've delved into Java, Go, Python, PHP, JavaScript, HTML, CSS,
                and SQL, and I'm proficient in using tools like Git, GitHub, and
                Docker.
                <br />
                My projects, including a Bakery Online Ordering System and
                Campus Connect: Academic Record System, demonstrate my ability
                to create functional solutions and my commitment to continuous
                learning.
                <br />
                My educational background includes studies in System Development
                at Boston City Campus and completion of CS50 Introduction to
                Computer Science, where I gained a solid understanding of
                programming fundamentals, data structures, and algorithms.
                <br />
                I'm eager to apply my knowledge and skills in a real-world
                setting, and I'm ready to learn and grow within a supportive
                team environment.
                <br />
                If you're looking for a dedicated and motivated junior developer
                to join your team, I'd love to chat and explore how I can
                contribute to your projects.
